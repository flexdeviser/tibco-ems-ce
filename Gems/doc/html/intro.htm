    <p>
        Gems is written in Java and compiled using jdk1.6. Thus a Java run-time environment is needed and this should be at least version 1.6 or greater. 
        To use the example executable rungems.cmd the Java JRE bin directory must be in 
        the system path.</p>
  <p>Gems supports TIBCO EMS version 5.0 or later. In order to run 
      Gems the TIBCO EMS client jar files must be installed and&nbsp; included on the CLASSPATH.</p>
  <p>Note: To use Gems with TIBCO EMS version 8.0 client or later requires JRE 1.7</p>
    <p>To use the charting features the JFreeChart libraries jcommon-1.0.23.jar and jfreechart-1.0.19.jar must be downloaded from <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart">http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart</p>
    </a>

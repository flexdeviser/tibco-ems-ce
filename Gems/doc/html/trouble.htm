<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>In general, if you experience any problems check the Gems command window for errors.</p>

<h3>Gems fails to start</h3>
<p>If Gems fails to start check the following:</p>

<lu>
<li>JRE 1.6.0 or higher is installed and the bin directory is in your path. To check this open a command prompt and type <em>java -version</em></li>
<li>TIBCO EMS is installed</li>
<li>If EMS is not installed in the standard tibco home directory set the %TIBEMS_ROOT% variable in the rungems.cmd file to the EMS installation directory</li>
</lu>

<h3>Gems fails to connect</h3>
<p>If Gems fails to connect to an EMS server check the following:</p>

<lu>
<li>The supplied URL's hostname and TCP port are correct</li>
<li>The supplied EMS user name and password is correct</li>
<li>The supplied EMS user  has administrative rights</li>
<li>There is network connectivity to the EMS server machine</li>
</lu>

<h3>"Not Permitted" Error when using Destination Monitors</h3>
<p>If you have created a new administrator user for Gems and you also wish to use the Topic/Queue monitor or Request/Reply monitor,
you must also grant this user subscribe permission to the <code>$sys.monitor</code> topics. See the Security Permissions section for details.</p>

<h3>"Not Permitted" Error when starting Gems</h3>
<p>If you have created a new administrator user for Gems and you also wish to use the Event Monitor feature
you must also grant this user subscribe permission to the <code>$sys.monitor</code> topics that are configured in the EventMonitor section in the <code>servers.xml</code> file. See the Security Permissions section for details.</p>


<h3>Gems display freezes</h3>
<p>If the Gems display appears to be frozen, this may be because an EMS server is in recovery mode. </p>
<p>When an EMS server activates, either as a result of a failover or on restart, 
the server has to recover all pending messages that were saved to disk. In exceptional cases, 
where there are a large number of pending messages, this may take a few moments. 
During this time the server accepts connections but will not process any requests until the server has fully recovered.
Wait for the server to recover, and Gems will continue normally.

<h3>Cannot browse pending messages</h3>
<p>Messages that have been sent to a client application and not yet acknowledged, or messages that have been sent to the EMS client library and held in a prefetch queue CANNOT be browsed. If this condition persists its possible that the client application has stalled and may need to be shutdown.</p>
